# Lightspeed eCom PHP API client
This package is a convenience wrapper to communicate with the Lightspeed eCom REST-API.


## Requirements
To use the Lightspeed eCom PHP API client, the following things are required:

+ PHP >= 5.4
+ cURL, JSON, mbstring and FileInfo PHP extensions


## Installation

By far the easiest way to install the Lightspeed eCom PHP API client is to require it with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

``` bash
$ composer require seoshop/seoshop-php:^1.9
```
```json
{
    "require": {
        "seoshop/seoshop-php": "^1.9"
    }
}
```


### Manual Installation
Obtain the latest version of the Lightspeed eCom PHP API client
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/SEOshop/API-PHP-Client
```

And include the class in your project
``` php
require_once '/path/to/lightspeed-php-sdk/src/ApiClient.php';
```

## Usage
There are a lot of API resources that are accessible through this client. You can look them up by looking at the code. Their name matches the name in the documentation.

``` php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new \Lightspeed\ApiClient('[api-server]', '[api-key]', '[api-secret]', '[language]');

$shopInfo = $client->shop->get();
```

__Explanation__

[api-server]
Available server(-clusters): live, eu1, us1

[api-key]
The API key you've received or created

[api-secret]
The API secret you've received or created

[language]
Language shortcode that's available in the shop you're connecting to

## Fetching response headers
After making a call, you can fetch the response headers from our API server and use it to check important data such as rate limiting.

``` php
$shopInfo = $client->shop->get();
$response = $shopInfo->getResponseHeaders();
```
