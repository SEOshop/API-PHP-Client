```

## Usage
There are a lot of API resources that are accessible through this client. You can look them up by looking at the code. Their name matches the name in the documentation.

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new WebshopappApiClient('[api-server]', '[api-key]', '[api-secret]', '[language]');

$shopInfo = $client->shop->get();
```
